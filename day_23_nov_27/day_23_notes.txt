Node.js Path Module
===================
-The Path module provides a way of working with directories and file paths.
sep	        Returns the segment separator specified for the platform
delimiter	Returns the delimiter specified for the platform
basename()	Returns the last part of a path
dirname()	Returns the directories of a path
extname()	Returns the file extension of a path
format()	Formats a path object into a path string
isAbsolute()	Returns true if a path is an absolute path, otherwise false
join()	Joins the specified paths into one
normalize()	normalizes the given path, resolving '..' and '.' segments.
parse()	Formats a path string into a path object
relative()	Returns the relative path from one specified path to another specified path
resolve()	Resolves the specified paths into an absolute path
win32	Returns an object containing Windows specific properties and methods
posix	Returns an object containing POSIX specific properties and methods


Q. why youâ€™d use the path.join() function instead of using string concatenation??
ans: 1. Supports separators (\ or /) for different OS.
	 2. handles leading and trailing slashes.
	    path.join('data', 'test.txt'); // 'data/test.txt'
		path.join('data', '/test.txt'); // 'data/test.txt'
		path.join('data/', 'test.txt'); // 'data/test.txt'
		path.join('data/', '/test.txt'); // 'data/test.txt'


join() vs resolve()
===================
-join() concatenates(joins) the path segments.
-resolve() creates an absolute path from the root. 

-Both methods will normalize the paths i.e. they treat .. as we normally use them when navigating in the folder structure.

-join() concatenates the the path fragments.
-resolve() looks for the first segment with / from the right and append everything up to this point to the root.

Query String Module
===================
-Node.js Query String module provides methods to deal with query string. 
-It can be used to convert query string into JSON object and vice-versa.
-querystring module has methods like:
	parse() / decode()
	stringify() / encode()
	escape()
	unescape()
querystring.parse(str[, sep][, eq][, options])	queryString To object.
querystring.stringify(obj[, sep][, eq][, options]) object to string.

-characters such as "/", "?", "#", ":", "@", "&", "=", "+", "$", and ",". When these characters need to be included in a URL as data rather than as part of the URL syntax, they must be percent-encoded / escaped. 
-For instance, the character "@" is encoded as "%40", and the character "#" is encoded as "%23".

let str = 'https://example.com/path/to/page?name=sanjay_samantra&color=dark blue';
let queryStr = url.parse(str).query; // 




Process Module
==============
-Process Module provides the env property which hosts all the environment variables that were set at the moment the process was started.
Note: process does not need a "require", it's automatically available.
-If you have multiple environment variables in your node project, create an .env file in the root directory of project, and then use the 'dotenv' package to load them during runtime.
.env file
	USER_ID="239482"
	USER_KEY="abcd"
	NODE_ENV="development"
	PORT=1234
-npm install dotenv
 require('dotenv').config();
	process.env.USER_ID; // "239482"
	process.env.USER_KEY; // "abcd"
	process.env.NODE_ENV; // "development"
-How to find which version of V8 ships with a particular version of Node.js?
	node -p process.versions.v8
-process.nextTick() : invoke this function at the end of the current operation, before the  next event loop tick starts
-This function defers the execution of a callback function until the next Event Loop Iteration.
-Every time the event loop takes a full trip, we call it a tick.
-setTimeout(() => {}, 0) will execute the function at the end of next tick, much later than when using nextTick() which prioritizes the call and executes it just before the beginning of the next tick
 


Node.js, the difference between development and production
==========================================================
-We can have different configurations for production and development environments.
-Node.js assumes it's always running in a development environment.
-We can signal Node.js that we are running in production by setting the NODE_ENV=production environment variable
 
 NODE_ENV=production node app.js  (environemnt variable)
 
 node --env-file=.env  app.js (environment file)
 node --env-file=.development.env app.js
 node --env-file=.qa.env app.js
 node --env-file=.prod.env app.js
 
Note: if the same variable is defined in the environment and in the file, the value from the environment takes precedence.
 
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  app.use(express.errorHandler({ dumpExceptions: true, showStack: true }));
}
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  app.use(express.errorHandler());
