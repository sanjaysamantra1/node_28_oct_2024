Aggregation Operations
======================
-Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed results
-Used to: 
	1. Group values from multiple documents together.
	2. Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.
	3. Analyze data changes over time.



Aggregation Pipelines
======================
-An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents.
-Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.
-The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage as input.
-An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.

-db.collectionName.aggregate(pipeline, options)
 input --> $match  --> $group --> $sort --> output

$match, $group, $limit, $project, $sort, $addFields, $count, $lookup, $out , $unwind
