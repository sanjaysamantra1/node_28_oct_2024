Helmet
======
-It Helps to secure Node.js application by setting several HTTP headers.
-automatically adds or removs HTTP headers to comply with web security standards.
-protect Node.js Express apps from common security threats such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and click-jacking attacks.
-Express applications do not come with security HTTP headers out of the box.
-Without Helmet, default headers returned by Express expose sensitive information and make your Node.js app vulnerable to malicious actors


curl http://localhost:3000/
curl http://localhost:3000/ --include
Or
use an HTTP client such as Postman to inspect the HTTP headers of the response

without Helmet
==============
-response header should have X-Powered-By header. As with all headers that begin with X-, it is a non-standard header. X-Powered-By indicates the name and version number of the framework or library used by the server to generate the HTTP response.
-we should never give attackers details about our tech stack.

Events
======
-Node.js allows us to create and handle custom events easily by using events module.
-Event module includes EventEmitter class which can be used to raise and handle custom events.
-An event can be raised/triggered using emit(). in emit() First parameter is the name of the event as a string and then arguments.
 ex:  emit(eventName)
	  emit(eventName, arg1 , arg2)
-An event can be emitted with zero or more arguments. 
-We can specify any name for a custom event in the emit() function.
-use addListener() / on() to subscribe/listen an event. 

-Event names should be camel-cased strings but any valid name should be fine. 
-Listeners should not return any value , Any values returned by the called listeners are ignored and will be discarded.

-The EventEmitter calls all listeners synchronously in the order in which they were registered.
-This ensures the proper sequencing of events and helps avoid race conditions and logic errors. 
When appropriate, listener functions can switch to an asynchronous mode of operation using the setImmediate() or process.nextTick() methods:
-Using the eventEmitter.once() method, it is possible to register a listener that is called at most once for a particular event. 
-Once the event is emitted, the listener is unregistered and then called.

 
EventEmitter Properties and Methods
------------------------------------
addListener()-			Adds the specified listener
defaultMaxListeners-	Sets the maximum number of listeners allowed for one event. Default is 10
emit()					Call all the listeners registered with the specified name
eventNames()			Returns an array containing all registered events
getMaxListeners()		Returns the maximum number of listeners allowed for one event
listenerCount()			Returns the number of listeners with the specified name
listeners()				Returns an array of listeners with the specified name
on()					Adds the specified listener
once()					Adds the specified listener once. When the specified listener has been executed, the listener is removed
prependListener()		Adds the specified listener as the first event with the specified name
prependOnceListener()	Adds the specified listener as the first event with the specified name, once. When the specified listener has been executed, the listener is removed
removeAllListeners()	Removes all listeners with the specified name, or ALL listeners if no name is specified
removeListener()		Removes the specified listener with the specified name
setMaxListeners()		Sets the maximum number of listeners allowed for one event. Default is 10


Template Engines for Node.js
============================
-A template engine enables us to use static template files in our application. 
-At runtime, the template engine replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client.
-Template engines for Node.js (Jade/pug,Vash,EJS,Handlebars)
-Express application generator uses 'pug' as the default Template Engine.

-To render template files, set the following application properties, in app.js
 app.engine('pug', require('pug').__express)
 app.set('views', './views')
 app.set('view engine', 'pug')
