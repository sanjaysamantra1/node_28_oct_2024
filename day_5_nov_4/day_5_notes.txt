Functions
=========
1. Pre-Defined 
   console.log() , document.write() , window.alert() , Math.max() , Math.min()
2. user-Defined
   a. Function Declaration
   b. Function Expression
   c. Self Invoked / Immediately Invoked Function Expression
   d. Arrow Function


Declaration vs Expression
=========================
1. function declarations are named functions, function expressions are anonymous
2. function declarations are hoisted , function expressions are not hoisted.


SelfInvoked
============
-to invoke some logic only 1 during the page load
-IIFEs cann't be invoked more than 1


Arrow Function
==============
-ECMAScript 6 (2015)



Arrow Function Limitations:
==========================
-Arrow functions shouldn't be used as Object methods, if arrow functions are declared as object methods, inside the function this = window / global
-Arrow functions shouldn't be used where 'this' value has to be dynamic.


Arrow Function Benefits:
========================
