NodeJS Buffers
==============
-Buffer represents a fixed-length sequence of bytes.
-Buffer is a built-in object used to handle binary data directly, without needing to convert it into string or other format.
-to preocess raw binary data, such as reading data from file handling network communication.
-Buffers are used with readable & writable streams for efficient data handling, especially for large files.
-Buffers are essential when dealing with image data. Images are typically handled as binary data while sending over a network.




Node.js Streams
===============
-Streams are objects that let you read data from a source or write data to a destination in continuous fashion.
-When we try to read a file, the contents of the file is read and all the content gets saved in memory
-Streams read chunks of data piece by piece, processing its content without keeping it all in memory.

-4 types of streams in Node.js:
1.Readable    fs.createReadStream()
2.writeable   fs.createWriteStream()
3.Duplex      net.Socket 
  A Duplex stream is both readable and writable, meaning it can consume input and produce output at the same time.
4.Transform


Piping the Streams:
-Piping is a mechanism where we provide the output of one stream as the input to another stream.
