function closure
================
-When an inner function accesses any data from the outer function, a 'closure' scope gets attached to the inner function.hence inner function can access outer function data.

-A closure is an inner function that has access to its outer function's variables even after the outer function's execution is Completed/Closed.

-When the outer function execution completes, you’d expect all its variables to be no longer accessible. However, if the inner function uses variables from the outer function, those variables remain accessible.

-The inner function retains access to the outer function’s scope, because the inner function ‘remembers’ the environment in which it was created.

Note:
=====
-outer functions will never have closure scope attached
-all the inner functions will not have closure scope attached, only the inner functions which are trying to access outer functions data will have closure scope
